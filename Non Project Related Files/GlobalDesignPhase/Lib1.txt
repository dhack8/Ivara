Descriptive Name: Renderer/Animator Library

Informal interface:
These are the classes involved; ProcessingRenderer, SpriteComponent, AnimatedSpriteComponent
They will be in charge of basically drawing a given scene using the sprites. When requested to draw and
provided a scene object from the game the renderer will take the scenes state and draw it. It will 
work with sprites and animated sprites and maybe the assetManager to draw all the needed images.
