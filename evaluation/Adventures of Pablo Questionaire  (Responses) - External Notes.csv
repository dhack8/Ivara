Emily Longhurst,Evaluation Notes,Enjoyed playing but didn't give a 5/5 as platformer games are not their go-to
,,Wouldn't go back and play the game again after finishing it a first time
,,Liked the insentive of having coins to purchase skins within the store
,,Found the game rather easy because it was short
,,
James Watt,Gameplay Notes,Surprised that the username was pre-filled on loading the game
,,The fall-jump mechanic was not intuitive
,,Noticed the double-jump ability by both testing and reading the level blurb
,,Double jump is way more natural than the fall-jump.
,,Spent a decent amount of time reading each level blurb.
,,Foliage blocks the terrain.
,,Thought that the end flag on final boots level was a checkpoint and tried to go there right away.
,,"Quit the final boots level because it was repetitive and time consuming, no fun in collecting the boxes. Not building upon skills or anything. Death fully reset progress which was frustrating."
,,"Surprised when crossbow didn't kill. Crossbow bolts can't physically interact with ghost, but you can physically interact with it."
,,The crossbow wasn't informative as to what enemies it could kill.
,,Thought you could have multiple characters within your party through what the store states.
,,Thought that the abilities stated on each level were given going into the level rather than a reward coming out of the level.
,Evaluation Notes,Will go back and replay if the player can get equipment that betters the gameplay. Will try beat best times with new tools.
,,The last few games he's played are purely based on story the games provide
,,Doesn't see the point in other characters if there are no benefits with abilities.
,,
Arnold Darel,Gameplay Notes,Tried using AWSD to move the character on the world map
,,Tried using escape to close inputs.
,,When you die there's no popup. Get thrown back to the checkpoint. A little jarring.
,,Trees blocking pathway.
,,Instantly replayed to do a speedrun as he noticed highscores and times to beat
,,Was surprised to respawn at a checkpont (didn't realise what the checkpoint flag was)
,,Surprised when the crossbow couldn't kill enemies
,,Very concious of time within game.
,,Took multiple levels to realise the fall-jump
,,Tried to go for speed run time and got bronze. Likes the medal being shown.
,,Attempting the challenging squiggly enemy section of the second boots level.
,,Uses restart functionality to speedrun.
,,Likes how the story matches up with the map
,,Look to have a single introductory level rather than one per each area.
,,End flag is not obvious.
,,"""Why can I stand on top of this tree and not the other one."""
,,Wants coins that are inaccessible.
,,Didn't know that he always had arrows. Wasn't clear they unlocked after the level.
,,Discovered level replayability with double jumps.
,,"When coins are cleared, not sure why there are ""pointless"" areas."
,,Selected store character is ambiguous.
,,
Shaun Sinclair,Gameplay Notes,Noticed the visual change to the boots very late (level 3).
,,"""Does holding down the w key make you jump longer?"""
,,Did not notice rewards at all.
,,Bailed on final level because of its length and repetitive nature
,,Identified that he can play the game in different orders for different unlocks.
,,Expect to have the crossbow before playing the level for the first crossbow level
,,Understood the reskin in the shop and the interface
,,"Music is quite good, didn't necessarily get in your head."
,,Harder to learn the controls and powerups when everything is being learnt at once.
,,"""Oh so you can run round and unlock things from different levels."""
,,Didn't notice that there was a slime there when there was a bush behind it.
,,Did not notice rewards until it was pointed out on the last level.
,,Didn't notice the medals.
,,"If he really enjoyed the game, he'd go back and try get the best time."
,Evaluation Notes,Consistent UI to other games that he has played with the level map.
,,Visually boring because of the gradient backdrop.
,,"""Drop jump is not clear. However I should have noticed."""
,,Marginally harder not knowing how the controls and stuff worked. - Need an intro level.
,,"Side menu could be more noticible. Block of text was too much, didn't stop to read it."
,,
Leyton Blackler,Gameplay Notes,Noticed rewards come after completing a level
,,Didn't recognise it's a checkpoint
,,Assumed there's no lives
,,Noticed the fall jump in the first level
,,Noticed the backtracking functionality after completing first boots level to get all the coins
,,Needed clearer indication as to whether the checkpoint had been hit
,,"Until more involved in the storyline, doesn't feel the need to get more skins"
,,Would be nice to see how many coins he has without going into the store
,,"Not really driven by high scores, didn't check once"
,Evaluation Notes,If he completed everything else he'd go back for store content 
,,
Sean Stevenson,Gameplay Notes,No clue where he's starting on the map
,,All the menu items should be grouped together
,,Looked at the rewards before starting the level 
,,No information as to how to play -- should have introductory level
,,Used the drop jump functionality straight away when needed
,,Didn't notice multiple paths
,,Forgot about the double jump - from the previously stated reward
,,Went back and collected coins on completed level
,,Went back for speedrun
,Evaluation,"Was clear that he died, wasn't clear why he died because the hotboxes were too large."
,,It felt like every jump being super precise was rather difficult
,,
Celine Young,Gameplay Notes,Hit load instinctively to load a level of the game 
,,"Hitboxes were off, confused as to why she kept dieing"
,,Suprised when the bow didn't kill ghosts
,,The reward section on the map looks like the player has access to the ability on entering the level
,,Looking for an alternate / easier route within the level. Skip the coins.
,,Looking for another way to respawn.
,,"""Wants to"" stop playing but keeps playing for the sake of completing the difficult level."
