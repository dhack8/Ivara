Physics Library - Swen 222 Project

The physics module has these key features:
Colliders
AABB
Circle
Collision Detection
Spatial Collection
Utility Physics Functions
Ray casting
Minimum Distance Between

The core part of the module has no explicit interface, rather it is simply a collection of classes that provide a way to describe and model a physical world. The way to utilise this library is to encapsulate the desired features in project specific classes.

For example, for the purpose of interfacing with Ivara, a PhysicsComponent class is also provided that connects an Entity and Collider.
