Does holding down the w key make you jump longer?

Tried to jump on the barnacle to his demise.

Found that you can jump off the slimes.

Falling jumps not obvious.

No points/rewards for killing enemies.

Wasn't aware of upgrade to jump.

Did not notice rewards until it was pointed out on the last level.

Thought the box would crush the barnacle.

Assumes quit from pause goes to the world map.

Identified that he can play the game in different orders for different unlocks.

Music nice.

Didn't notice that there was a slime there when there was a bush behind it.

Gradient backgrounds are boring and uninteresting.

Harder to learn the controls and powerups when everything is being learnt at once.
